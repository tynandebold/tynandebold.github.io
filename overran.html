    <h3 class="group-title">Overran</h3>
    <i>August 2016</i>
    <p>my flat is full now but sometimes when i open my eyes and look i see nothing</br>
because i think of you and since you’re not here everything is stripped away<p>

<p>and i think about what this space was like before your laughter bounced from</br>
wall to wall before it rose up from the rooftop and fell softly on the treetops</p>

<p>but when you were here last there were no leaves on the trees to slow the wind</br>
hitting the windows and i become pensive because that’s an analogy</p>

<p>for what i can’t decide though it could apply to what happened between you</br>
and me but so could many things when it hurt as good and as bad as that did</p>

<p>like when my heart overran my mind and i involuntarily told you i loved you</br>
and all at once i felt the uncomfortable couch and the weight of the world as i realized it was true</p>

<p>or when i sat in the same place on a more comfortable couch watching you</br>
slowly inch out of the door and out of an uncomfortable conversation</p>

<p>and ultimately out of my life because that’s the last time you were here</br>
and i asked you please don’t go and you did and i was left in a vacuum</p>

<p>fighting for air for which you seemed to be the sole source yet there was</br>
enough left over for existing alone and i learned to fill my lungs</p>

<p>as i now fill just one coffee cup and make one serving of pancakes in the morning</br>
and i feel nearly as full again as i did when you ate them with me</p>

<p>always faster than me and faster and faster we both went keeping up with one</br>
another well until we overran our own love and lives</p>

<p>and you closed the door on me as fast as i had first walked through one to see</br>
you standing there ready and waiting for hungry customers</p>

<p><p>never expecting to find one willing to give so much love<p></p>
