    <i>August 2016</i>
    <p>my flat is full now but sometimes when i open my eyes and look i see nothing
because i think of you and since you’re not here everything is stripped away</p>
<p>and i think about what this space was like before your laughter bounced from
wall to wall before it rose up from the rooftop and fell softly on the treetops </p>
<p>but when you were here last there were no leaves on the trees to slow the wind
hitting the windows and i become pensive because that’s an analogy </p>
<p>for what i can’t decide though it could apply to what happened between you
and me but so could many things when it hurt as good and as bad as that did</p>
<p>like when my heart overran my mind and i involuntarily told you i loved you
and all at once i felt the uncomfortable couch and the weight of the world as i realized it was true</p>
<p>or when i sat in the same place on a more comfortable couch watching you
slowly inch out of the door and out of an uncomfortable conversation </p>
<p>and ultimately out of my life because that’s the last time you were here
and i asked you please don’t go and you did and i was left in a vacuum </p>
<p>fighting for air for which you seemed to be the sole source yet there was
enough left over for existing alone and i learned to fill my lungs </p>
<p>as i now fill just one coffee cup and make one serving of pancakes in the morning
and i feel nearly as full again as i did when you ate them with me </p>
<p>always faster than me and faster and faster we both went keeping up with one
another well until we overran our own love and lives </p>
<p>and you closed the door on me as fast as i had first walked through one to see
you standing there ready and waiting for hungry customers</p>
<p>never expecting to find one willing to give so much love</p>
