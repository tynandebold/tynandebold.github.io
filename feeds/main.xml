        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Through revolving doors</br>
We walk each night</br>
Matching minutes</br>

The overlay of the sky</br>
Grows dark, dark,</br>
Darker</br>

Down the stairs, light</br>
Follows me, but up</br>
I’m greeted by black</br>

I add a layer each night</br>
With greater weight</br>
I'm covered]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[my flat is full now but sometimes when i open my eyes and look i see nothing</br>
because i think of you and since you’re not here everything is stripped away</br>

and i think about what this space was like before your laughter bounced from</br>
wall to wall before it rose up from the rooftop and fell softly on the treetops</br> 

but when you were here last there were no leaves on the trees to slow the wind</br>
hitting the windows and i become pensive because that’s an analogy</br>

for what i can’t decide though it could apply to what happened between you</br>
and me but so could many things when it hurt as good and as bad as that did</br>

like when my heart overran my mind and i involuntarily told you i loved you</br>
and all at once i felt the uncomfortable couch and the weight of the world as i realized it was true</br>

or when i sat in the same place on a more comfortable couch watching you</br>
slowly inch out of the door and out of an uncomfortable conversation</br>

and ultimately out of my life because that’s the last time you were here</br>
and i asked you please don’t go and you did and i was left in a vacuum</br>

fighting for air for which you seemed to be the sole source yet there was</br>
enough left over for existing alone and i learned to fill my lungs</br>

as i now fill just one coffee cup and make one serving of pancakes in the morning</br>
and i feel nearly as full again as i did when you ate them with me</br>

always faster than me and faster and faster we both went keeping up with one</br>
another well until we overran our own love and lives</br>

and you closed the door on me as fast as i had first walked through one to see</br>
you standing there ready and waiting for hungry customers</br>

never expecting to find one willing to give so much love

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[one block east and one block south there is a park. there is no grass. the
surfaces are smooth. one soccer field and three basketball courts, submerged in
the middle of a sea of tall buildings. i'm sitting on the concrete stands.
fourth section down, sixth row up, seventh seat in. three fans affixed to
trestles above are blowing down. in jeans, boots, and a short-sleeved button
down, i'm comfortable, even cool. the moving air is refreshing, a temporary
respite from the suffocating, all-encompassing humidity that has been a faithful
partner my entire stay. there’s a new sound and when i look up i see it’s
raining. i don’t have an umbrella but i won’t need one. showers move through
fast and frequent. the rain is refreshing. it’s cooler now, and i'm content.
